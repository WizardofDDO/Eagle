Eagle

Projects created using Eagle 6.5.0

I was inspired to see if I could create the driver circuit for an RGB LED cube as seen on
Ytube so I downloaded Eagle 6.5.0 and got started. The method explained in the vidio seemed 
way too complicated for my taste so I put my brain to work and came up with the 8x8x8 version.
Next, I attempted to expand it to 16x16x16. Note, the latter is not finished and probably never
will be. It lacks power and ground as well as other things but its a good starting place for
anyone interested in finishing it. Dispite my joy at having a REAL electronics CAD program
I found some things just easier to do in paint, thus the gif files. Enjoy; The Wizard
